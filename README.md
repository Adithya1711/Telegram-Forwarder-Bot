# Telegram-Forwarder-Bot
I have spent too much time in telegram and found that this bot I made makes my work easier to forward messages to a specified channel or group without " Forwarded From blah blah " tag.

# Requirements
  * Python
  * Telebot library

# Installation
  pip install pytelegrambotapi

# Usage
After the installation of the package, update the bot token and destination channel to your bot token and destination channel id respectively and then run the python file.
You can get the chat id with the help of https://t.me/myidbot.

# Special Usage 
You can use this bot to clone a channel or group so that you can retain the messages even if the channel has got copyright strike, this bot is designed in such a way.

# Important

I felt that this knowledge should be shared but never misused so that's it.
